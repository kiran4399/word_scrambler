# word_scrambler

Simple word scrambler game but made in hindi. I used a word find library called word_find.js made by Bull Bunket and made this puzzle.

How to play:
Launch the index.html page and look at the letter matrix. See if you can find any of the words in the right section of the html page. The words are vertical, horizontal and diagonally arranged in the letter matrix. Once you click on any letter on the letter matrix it will be shown in yellow colour and when you drag in an appropriate direction and if the word is present in the word-list it will be shown in blue colour and the appropriate word will be striked out.
